You may have an issue with linking to MongoDB because your IP address isn't listed in the allowed addresses.

## TODO
* Hook create acount to login, so after you create an account you are redirected to login
* Move database variables to .env file
* If no database connection: give output to console before starting front end; you can try to login for ~2 minutes before you realize the connection was never established
